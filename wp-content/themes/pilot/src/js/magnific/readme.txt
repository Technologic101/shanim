Documentation for Magnific Popup can be found here:

The default build included in Pilot includes all options, but custom builds can be created to reduce the file size.

The 'sass' folder contains the default SCSS file for Magnific Popup. The settings file can be edited for quick changes, or these rules can be modified or removed as necessary.

The video popup example used in the Pilot demo requires the class mapping of '.mfp-media' in Site Options > Global Modules.  Selecting this option when building a media module will open the link in a popup.  Options for popup behavior can be found in main.js.
