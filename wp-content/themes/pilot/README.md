# Pilot

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `Pilot`. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.

My ultra-minimal CSS might make me look like theme tartare but that means less stuff to get in your way when you're designing your awesome theme. 

## Features

* [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) build script that compiles Sass, checks for JavaScript errors and concatenates and minifies files.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) for front-end package management.
* [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) for an optional grid.
* A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
* A helpful 404 template.
* A sample custom header implementation in inc/custom-header.php that can be activated by uncommenting one line in functions.php and adding the code snippet found in the comments of inc/custom-header.php to your header.php template.
* Custom template tags in inc/template-tags.php that keep your templates clean and neat and prevent code duplication.
* Some small tweaks in inc/extras.php that can improve your theming experience.


## Getting Started

### Install Grunt and Bower

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g grunt bower`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`
